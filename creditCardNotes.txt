Anatomy of a Credit Card Number:
The last digit is the checksum
If we don't have the last digit, then it can be found by doing last_digit = 10 - ((sum % 10) % 10)
First digit is represents the network that produced the card
 
Visa cards: 
	- Begins with a 4 and have 13 or 16 digits
	- Digits 2-6 are the bank number
	- Digits 7-12 or 7-15 represent the account number
	- Digit 13 or 16 is the checksum
 
Mastercard cards:
	- Begins with a 5 (or 2 for 2-series) and has 16 digits
	- Second digit ranges from 1-5 (inclusive) 
	- Digits 2 & 3, 2-4, 2-5, or 2-6: Make up the bank number; depends on whether digit two is a 1, 2, 3 or other digit
	- Digits after the bank number, up to digit 15: Represent the account number
	- Digit 16: Is a checksum
	- Conflicts with diners Club because both can start with 55
 
American Express (AMEX) cards:
	- Begins with a 37 or 34 and has 15 digits
	
Discover cards:
	- Begins with 6011 or 65 and has 16 digits
	- Also beginning can range from 622126‑622925 and 644‑649 and have 16 digits?
 
Diners Club and Carte Blanche cards:
	- Begins with 300-305 (inclusive), 309, 36, 38, or 39 and has 14 digits
	- Begins with 54 or 55 and has 16 digits 
 
Japanese Credit Bureau (JCB) cards:
	- If it begins with 3, then it has 16 digits
	- If it starts with 2123 or 1800, then it has 15 digits
 
UnionPay cards:
	- Begins with 62 and has 16-19 digits (inclusive)
 
We will run all other valid numbers through Luhn's Algorithm and if they pass, they will be labeled as "Other"
