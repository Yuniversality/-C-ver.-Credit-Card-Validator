# Credit Card Validator (C++ Ver.)  
By Ethan Yu  

## What is it?  
This credit card validator takes in a credit card number (either from user or file input) and 
sees if the number would be a valid credit card number. If valid, then it will try to deduce 
the issuing company.  
Currently, the following companies are supported: __Visa, Mastercard, American Express (AMEX)
Discover, Diner's Club, Japanese Credit Bureau (JCB), UnionPay__. All other valid numbers
will be labeled as "Other".  

Please note: This program only tells you if the credit card number is possible, **NOT** if
the number is active/in-use and chargable.  

## How to Use  
If you are on a Linux system, download the _[C++ Version] Credit Card Number Validator_ folder 
from this Github and run it by opening the terminal, going into the directory it is downloaded 
in, and typing in: 
> ./linuxCreditCardValidator.exe

If you are using Windows, download the _[C++ Version] Credit Card Number Validator_ folder
from this Github and navigate to it in your file explorer and run the _windowsCreditCardValidator.exe_
file.  

**If you are going to test using File Input, you must put the numbers you want to test in
the _userInput.txt_ file**  
_(If you choose to read from file input and don't have anything in the _userInpit.txt_ file, then the
program will auto-terminate)_  
That file is the designated file the program reads from. The program will terminate after
the file has been read and the numbers validated.  
If you want some valid dummy credit card numbers, check the _creditCardNumbers.txt_ and 
_creditCardNumbersAnswerKey.txt_ files and copy-and-paste some numbers from there to 
the _userInput.txt_ file.  

If you are testing using user input, then follow the on-screen prompts.
